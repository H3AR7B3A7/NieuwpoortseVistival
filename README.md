# NieuwpoortseVistival
End term assignment for Festival in Nieuwpoort

Author: H3AR7B3A7<br>
Property of: Erasmus highschool of Bruxelles

The assignment was to create an app for a festival in Nieuwpoort.
The app had to have a map for people to find their way and a program of artists playing at the festival.
Several other functionalities could only improve our mark once the MVP had been met.
We had about 3 days to present the results.

This was an early introduction to Swift in xCode and in no way represents what a real commercial app should look like.

Special thanks to: Swasse
